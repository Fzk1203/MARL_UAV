# MARL_UAV

# Introduction
This repository implements the proposed method from IEEE 2020 Paper [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based
Resource Allocation for UAV Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8807386)

# Quick Run
1. Install required packages in requirements.txt

python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run inference

# Future Work

1. Inference with GPU
2. Implement in the real work (if possible)
